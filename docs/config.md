# Config

This section will walk through the available configuration items.

Configuration snippets will be provided throughout this page. Feel free to copy the full [Sample Config](#sample-config) at the bottom of this page to customize.

## Frigate

### Server

- **server** (Required)
    - IP or hostname of the Frigate NVR

### WebAPI

!!! note
    Only one monitoring method can be configured, either `webapi` or `mqtt`. The other must be set to `enabled: false`.

### MQTT

!!! note
    Only one monitoring method can be configured, either `webapi` or `mqtt`. The other must be set to `enabled: false`.

- **enabled** (Optional - Default: `false`)
    - If set to `true`, Frigate events are collected via an MQTT broker
    - Note: This must be the same MQTT broker that Frigate is sending events to
- **server** (Required)
    - IP or hostname of the MQTT server
    - If MQTT monitoring is enabled, this field is required
- **port** (Optiona - Default: `1883`)
    - MQTT service port
- **clientid** (Optional - Default: `frigate-notify`)
    - Client ID of this app used when connecting to MQTT
    - Note: This must be a unique value & cannot be shared with other MQTT clients
- **username** (Optional)
    - MQTT username
    - If username & password are not set, then authentication is disabled
- **password** (Optional)
    - MQTT password
    - Required if `username` is set

```yaml title="Config File Snippet"
frigate:
  mqtt: 
    enabled: true
    server: mqtt.your.domain.local
    port: 1883
    clientid: frigate-notify
    username: mqtt-user
    password: mqtt-pass
```

### Cameras

- **exclude** (Optional)
    - If desired, provide a list of cameras to ignore
    - Any Frigate events on these cameras will not generate alerts
    - If left empty, this is disabled & all cameras will generate alerts

```yaml title="Config File Snippet"
frigate:
  cameras:
    exclude:
      - test_cam_01
      - test_cam_02
```

## Alerting

!!! note
    Any combination of alerting methods may be enabled, though you'll probably want to enable at least one! ðŸ˜…

### General

- **title** (Optional - Default: `Frigate Alert`)
    - Title of alert messages that are generated (Email subject, etc)
- **timeformat** (Optional - Default: `2006-01-02 15:04:05 -0700 MST`)
    - Optionally set a custom date/time format for notifications
    - This utilizes Golang's [reference time](https://go.dev/src/time/format.go) for formatting
    - See [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-formatting-in-golang) guide for help
    - Example below uses RFC1123 format

```yaml title="Config File Snippet"
alerts:  
  general:
    title: Frigate Alert
    timeformat: Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 MST
```

### Zones

This config section allows control over whether to generate alerts on all zones, or only specific ones. By default, the app will generate notifications on **all** Frigate events, regardless of whether the event includes zone info.

??? note "A note about how this works"
    
    **With MQTT**, Frigate will send a `new` event when a detection starts. Subsequent changes, like the detected object transitioning from one zone to another, will trigger `update` events. These `update` events will contain a list of current zone(s) that the object is in, as well as a list of all zones that the object has entered during the event.

    In order to reduce the number of notifications generated, this app will only alert on the *first time* the detected object enters a zone.

    For example, let's say you have a camera in your front yard with zones for sidewalk, driveway, and lawn - but only allow notifications for driveway and lawn. During an event someone was detected originally on the sidewalk, then driveway, lawn, and back to driveway. In this case, you should only receive two notifications. Once for the first time the person entered the driveway zone, and a second when they entered the lawn zone. 

    **With Web API event query**, we only query the event from Frigate one time. So currently, only one alert would be sent depending on the detected zones at the time the web API was queried for new events.

- **unzoned** (Optional - Default: `allow`)
    - Controls alerts on events outside a zone
    - By default, events without a zone will generate alerts
    - Set to `drop` to prevent generating alerts from events without a zone
- **allow** (Optional)
    - Specify a list of zones to allow notifications
    - All other zones will be ignored
    - If `unzoned` is set to `allow`, notifications will still be sent on events without any zone info
- **block** (Optional)
    - Specify a list of zones to always ignore
    - This takes precedence over the `allow` list

```yaml title="Config File Snippet"
alerts:
  zones:
    unzoned: allow
    allow:
     - test_zone_01
    block:
     - test_zone_02
```

### Discord

    - Set to `true` to enable alerting via Discord webhooks
- **webhook** (Required)

### Telegram

In order to use Telegram for alerts, a bot token & chat ID are required.

To obtain a bot token, follow [this](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) doc to message @BotFather.

Once you have a bot token, make sure to initiate a chat message with your bot. Then visit the following URL:

- `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` 
- Replace `<BOT_TOKEN>` with the API token provided by @BotFather. 

Within the response, locate your message to the bot, then grab the ID under `message > chat > id`. An example response is shown below, where `999999999` is the ID we need to save:

```json
{
  "update_id": 1234567,
  "message": {
    "chat": {
      "id": 999999999,
      "first_name": "Test User",
      "username": "test-username1234",
      "type": "private"
    }
  }
}
```

- **enabled** (Optional - Default: `false`)
    - Set to `true` to enable alerting via Telegram
